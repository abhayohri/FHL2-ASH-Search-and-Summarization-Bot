While this issue impacted only one scenario where customers used a pull-down refresh instead of interacting with the push notification, unfortunately it impacted one or more of your Azure subscriptions. That’s why we’re providing you with this Post Incident Review (PIR) – to summarize what went wrong, how we responded, and the steps Microsoft is taking to learn from this and improve.\\nWhat went wrong and why?\\nThe Microsoft Authenticator app has support for a client-initiated refresh to allow customers to poll for a pending notification from the service. A recent service update contained a new feature that exposed a code issue when refreshing the Microsoft Authenticator app using the Pull-to-Refresh feature on Android devices. This only impacted users that utilize the Pull-to-Refresh feature on specific versions of the Microsoft Authenticator app to receive the authentication notification. Interactions with push notifications were not affected. While the service update followed our safe deployment practices, this break was not detected until reported by customers as the volume of Microsoft Authenticator Pull-to-Refresh requests from Android devices is very low.\\nHow did we respond?\\nUpon receiving the customer reports, we investigated and identified the feature that was causing this experience degradation. A configuration override was prepared by 19:39 UTC on 21 March 2023 and safely rolled out to mitigate the impact by 22:20 UTC on 21 March 2023. Affected customers may have needed to re-register their devices for multi-factor authentication.\\nHow are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?\\nWe are enhancing our telemetry to detect these issues on a per flow granularity instead of a holistic one. This will show us immediately when one of these flows is affected by an issue in the future.\\nWe are also taking steps to ensure that low volume scenarios have adequate validations to help protect against the possibility of this kind of failure.\\nHow can customers make incidents like this less impactful?\\nFinally, consider ensuring that the right people in your organization will be notified about any future service issues - by configuring Azure Service Health alerts. These can trigger emails, SMS, push notifications, webhooks, and more: https://aka.ms/ash-alerts\\nHow can we make our incident communications more useful?\\nYou can rate this PIR and provide any feedback using our quick 3-question survey.', metadata={'source': 'FLX7-VD8'}),\n",

Apple iOS users, and other MFA methods, were not impacted.\\nWhat went wrong and why?\\nWe determined the cause of these push notification issues was due to an issue with a third-party provider's push notification service. We determined that calls to this service were experiencing a high rate of errors.\\xa0\\nHow did we respond?\\nWe were alerted to the issue by monitoring. We were able to fall back to a legacy system that was operating normally with minimal failures. We manually performed a failover following our safe deployment practices, which allowed MFA to completely recover. Once the third-party provider's push notification service recovered, we failed back the traffic.\\xa0\\nHow are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?\\nWe improved the resiliency of the service by configuring an automatic failover of push notification traffic to the legacy system if the primary system experiences degradation. (Completed)We are updating our public documentation, recommending customers to complete the MFA request (even without a push notification) by opening the Microsoft Authenticator app and approving.

But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways.

While this issue impacted only one scenario where customers used a pull-down refresh instead of interacting with the push notification, unfortunately it impacted one or more of your Azure subscriptions. That’s why we’re providing you with this Post Incident Review (PIR) – to summarize what went wrong, how we responded, and the steps Microsoft is taking to learn from this and improve.\\nWhat went wrong and why?\\nThe Microsoft Authenticator app has support for a client-initiated refresh to allow customers to poll for a pending notification from the service. A recent service update contained a new feature that exposed a code issue when refreshing the Microsoft Authenticator app using the Pull-to-Refresh feature on Android devices. This only impacted users that utilize the Pull-to-Refresh feature on specific versions of the Microsoft Authenticator app to receive the authentication notification. Interactions with push notifications were not affected. While the service update followed our safe deployment practices, this break was not detected until reported by customers as the volume of Microsoft Authenticator Pull-to-Refresh requests from Android devices is very low.\\nHow did we respond?\\nUpon receiving the customer reports, we investigated and identified the feature that was causing this experience degradation. A configuration override was prepared by 19:39 UTC on 21 March 2023 and safely rolled out to mitigate the impact by 22:20 UTC on 21 March 2023. Affected customers may have needed to re-register their devices for multi-factor authentication.\\nHow are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?\\nWe are enhancing our telemetry to detect these issues on a per flow granularity instead of a holistic one. This will show us immediately when one of these flows is affected by an issue in the future.\\nWe are also taking steps to ensure that low volume scenarios have adequate validations to help protect against the possibility of this kind of failure.\\nHow can customers make incidents like this less impactful?\\nFinally, consider ensuring that the right people in your organization will be notified about any future service issues - by configuring Azure Service Health alerts. These can trigger emails, SMS, push notifications, webhooks, and more: https://aka.ms/ash-alerts\\nHow can we make our incident communications more useful?\\nYou can rate this PIR and provide any feedback using our quick 3-question survey.', metadata={'source': 'FLX7-VD8'}), Document(page_content=\"What happened?\\nBetween 13:00 UTC and 14:05 UTC on 12 April 2023 you were identified as a customer using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) that may have experienced difficulties receiving push notifications on their Android phones due to an issue with a third-party provider. Apple iOS users, and other MFA methods, were not impacted.\\nWhat went wrong and why?\\nWe determined the cause of these push notification issues was due to an issue with a third-party provider's push notification service. We determined that calls to this service were experiencing a high rate of errors.\\xa0\\nHow did we respond?\\nWe were alerted to the issue by monitoring. We were able to fall back to a legacy system that was operating normally with minimal failures. We manually performed a failover following our safe deployment practices, which allowed MFA to completely recover. Once the third-party provider's push notification service recovered, we failed back the traffic.\\xa0\\nHow are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?\\nWe improved the resiliency of the service by configuring an automatic failover of push notification traffic to the legacy system if the primary system experiences degradation.
