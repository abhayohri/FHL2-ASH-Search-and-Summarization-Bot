This impacted users of Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, the Azure portal, as well as Azure services which depend upon ARM for their internal resource management operations.</p>\\n<p>The primary source of impact was limited to ARM API calls being processed in our West Europe region. This caused up to 50% of customer requests to this region to fail (approximately 3% of global requests at the time). This principally affected customers and workloads in geographic proximity to our West Europe region, while customers geographically located elsewhere would not have been impacted – with limited exceptions for VPN users and those on managed corporate networks. Additionally, Azure services that leverage the ARM API as part of their own internal workflows, and customers of these services, may have experienced issues managing Azure resources located in West Europe as a result.</p>\\n<p><strong>What went wrong and why?</strong></p>\\n<p>This incident was the result of a positive feedback loop leading to saturation on the ARM web API tier. This was caused by high-volume, short-held lock contention on the request serving path, which triggered a significant increase in spin-waits against these locks, driving up CPU load and preventing threads from picking up asynchronous background work. As a result of this, latency for long running asynchronous operations (such as outgoing database and web requests) increased, leading to timeouts. These timeouts caused both internal and external clients to retry requests, further increasing load and contention on these locks, eventually causing our Web API tier to saturate its available CPU capacity.</p>\\n<p>There are several factors which contribute to increasing the feedback\\u202fon this loop, however the ultimate trigger was the recent introduction of a cache used to reduce the time spent parsing complex feature flag definitions in hot loops. This change was intended to reduce the performance impact of using feature flags on the request serving path, and had been previously load tested and validated in our internal testing and canary environments - demonstrating a significant reduction in performance impact in these scenarios.</p>\\n<p>This change was rolled out following our standard safe deployment practices, progressively deployed to increasingly larger regions over the course of four days prior to being deployed to West Europe. Over this period, it was not exposed to the problematic call pattern, and none of these regions exhibited anomalous performance characteristics. When this change was deployed to our West Europe region, it was subjected to a call pattern unique to a specific internal service which exercised this cache path more heavily than the broad-spectrum workloads we had tested in our internal and canary environments.</p>\\n<p>Approximately 24 hours after it was deployed to West Europe, a spike in traffic from this internal service that executed a daily cache refresh was able to induce enough lock contention to start this positive feedback loop across a significant portion of the ARM web API instances in the region. This cascaded as the service in question retried failed requests and, over the course of 20 minutes, the region progressed from a healthy to heavily saturated state.</p>\\n<p>These recent contributors combined with several other factors to trigger and exacerbate the impact, including:</p>\\n<ul><li>A legacy API implementation – whose responses varied infrequently, made heavy use of costly data transforms on each request without caching.</li><li>The introduction of a new feature flag – which influenced the data transforms applied to this legacy API, as well as several others, in support of ongoing improvements to regional expansion workflows.</li><li>Internal retry logic – which has the potential for increasing load during a performance degradation scenario (but this also significantly improves customer experienced reliability in other scenarios).</li><li>External clients which implement retry logic that can increase load during a saturation scenario.</li></ul>\\n<p><strong>How did we respond?</strong></p>\\n<p>At 02:41 UTC we were alerted to a drop in regional availability for Azure Resource Manager in West Europe. This was 21 minutes after the first measurable deviation from nominal performance, and 6 minutes after the first significant drop in service availability for the region. Diagnosing the cause took an extended amount of time as the issue was obfuscated by several factors. First, we identified an increase in failures for calls to downstream storage dependencies, and an increase in both CPU usage and number of errors served from the reverse proxy layer in front of our Web API services. The impact appeared to correspond to a significant increase in CPU load without any visible increase in traffic to the region. This was not typical, and all dependencies in the region appeared to be healthy.</p>\\n<p>We were aware of the most recent deployment to this region happening about 24 hours earlier, however this region (and up to 20 others) had been operating nominally with this new code. Following our standard response guidance for saturation incidents, we scaled up our Web API tier in West Europe to reduce the impact to customers, however, these new instances were immediately saturated with incoming requests, having little impact on the region\\'s degraded availability. We also determined that shifting traffic away from this region was unlikely to improve the situation and had the potential to cause a multi-region incident, since the problem appeared to be contained within the ARM service and tied to a workload in West Europe.</p>\\n<p>As a result of the significant increase in CPU load, our internal performance profiling systems automatically began sampling call paths in the service. At 05:15 UTC, this profiling information is how were able to attribute the cause to a spin lock in our feature flagging system\\'s cache which was being triggered by a specific API. Using this information, we were able to identify the internal service responsible for the majority of calls to this API and confirmed that a spike in requests from this service was the trigger for the load increase. We engaged team members from this internal service and disabled the workload, while simultaneously blocking the client to reduce the generated load. By 06:30 UTC these changes succeeded, which in-turn reduced the incoming load and we started to observe improvements to regional availability in West Europe.</p>\\n<p>This availability continued to improve as our phased configuration rollout within the region progressed, improving the health of the platform . By 07:30 UTC, it had returned to nominal availability at &gt;99.999%. At 07:54 UTC we confirmed mitigation and transitioned into the investigation and repair phase. Once mitigation was confirmed, we set about hardening the system against any potential for a recurrence of the previous issue, starting first with a rollback of the latest code release in West Europe to the previous release. Simultaneously, we set to work reverting the code changes primarily responsible for triggering this failure mode and developing patches for the other contributing factors – including adjusting the caching system used for feature flags to remove the potential for lock contention, and adding caching to the legacy API responsible for generating this load to significantly reduce the potential for positive feedback loops on these request paths and others like them.</p>\\n<p><strong>How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?</strong></p>\\n<p></p><ul><li>We have rolled back the ARM release globally which contain code relating to this performance regression.

       "[Document(page_content='What happened?\\nYou were impacted by a platform issue that caused some of our Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) customers to experience issues when attempting a pull-down refresh using the Microsoft Authenticator app on Android devices, between 19:19 UTC on 6 Mar 2023 and 22:20 UTC on 21 March 2023. While this issue impacted only one scenario where customers used a pull-down refresh instead of interacting with the push notification, unfortunately it impacted one or more of your Azure subscriptions. That’s why we’re providing you with this Post Incident Review (PIR) – to summarize what went wrong, how we responded, and the steps Microsoft is taking to learn from this and improve.\\nWhat went wrong and why?\\nThe Microsoft Authenticator app has support for a client-initiated refresh to allow customers to poll for a pending notification from the service. A recent service update contained a new feature that exposed a code issue when refreshing the Microsoft Authenticator app using the Pull-to-Refresh feature on Android devices. This only impacted users that utilize the Pull-to-Refresh feature on specific versions of the Microsoft Authenticator app to receive the authentication notification. Interactions with push notifications were not affected. While the service update followed our safe deployment practices, this break was not detected until reported by customers as the volume of Microsoft Authenticator Pull-to-Refresh requests from Android devices is very low.\\nHow did we respond?\\nUpon receiving the customer reports, we investigated and identified the feature that was causing this experience degradation. A configuration override was prepared by 19:39 UTC on 21 March 2023 and safely rolled out to mitigate the impact by 22:20 UTC on 21 March 2023. Affected customers may have needed to re-register their devices for multi-factor authentication.\\nHow are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?\\nWe are enhancing our telemetry to detect these issues on a per flow granularity instead of a holistic one. This will show us immediately when one of these flows is affected by an issue in the future.\\nWe are also taking steps to ensure that low volume scenarios have adequate validations to help protect against the possibility of this kind of failure.\\nHow can customers make incidents like this less impactful?\\nFinally, consider ensuring that the right people in your organization will be notified about any future service issues - by configuring Azure Service Health alerts. These can trigger emails, SMS, push notifications, webhooks, and more: https://aka.ms/ash-alerts\\nHow can we make our incident communications more useful?\\nYou can rate this PIR and provide any feedback using our quick 3-question survey.', metadata={'source': 'FLX7-VD8'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"What happened?\\nBetween 13:00 UTC and 14:05 UTC on 12 April 2023 you were identified as a customer using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) that may have experienced difficulties receiving push notifications on their Android phones due to an issue with a third-party provider. Apple iOS users, and other MFA methods, were not impacted.\\nWhat went wrong and why?\\nWe determined the cause of these push notification issues was due to an issue with a third-party provider's push notification service. We determined that calls to this service were experiencing a high rate of errors.\\xa0\\nHow did we respond?\\nWe were alerted to the issue by monitoring. We were able to fall back to a legacy system that was operating normally with minimal failures. We manually performed a failover following our safe deployment practices, which allowed MFA to completely recover.

My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies.

And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

While this issue impacted only one scenario where customers used a pull-down refresh instead of interacting with the push notification, unfortunately it impacted one or more of your Azure subscriptions. That’s why we’re providing you with this Post Incident Review (PIR) – to summarize what went wrong, how we responded, and the steps Microsoft is taking to learn from this and improve.\\nWhat went wrong and why?\\nThe Microsoft Authenticator app has support for a client-initiated refresh to allow customers to poll for a pending notification from the service. A recent service update contained a new feature that exposed a code issue when refreshing the Microsoft Authenticator app using the Pull-to-Refresh feature on Android devices. This only impacted users that utilize the Pull-to-Refresh feature on specific versions of the Microsoft Authenticator app to receive the authentication notification. Interactions with push notifications were not affected. While the service update followed our safe deployment practices, this break was not detected until reported by customers as the volume of Microsoft Authenticator Pull-to-Refresh requests from Android devices is very low.\\nHow did we respond?\\nUpon receiving the customer reports, we investigated and identified the feature that was causing this experience degradation. A configuration override was prepared by 19:39 UTC on 21 March 2023 and safely rolled out to mitigate the impact by 22:20 UTC on 21 March 2023. Affected customers may have needed to re-register their devices for multi-factor authentication.\\nHow are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?\\nWe are enhancing our telemetry to detect these issues on a per flow granularity instead of a holistic one. This will show us immediately when one of these flows is affected by an issue in the future.\\nWe are also taking steps to ensure that low volume scenarios have adequate validations to help protect against the possibility of this kind of failure.\\nHow can customers make incidents like this less impactful?\\nFinally, consider ensuring that the right people in your organization will be notified about any future service issues - by configuring Azure Service Health alerts.

Once the third-party push notification service declared mitigation, we failed back the traffic.\\nHow are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?\\nWe have updated our troubleshooting guide to consider failing over the traffic to legacy channel for push notification traffic for Android if the primary channel is experiencing degradation (Completed).We are working on improving the resiliency to automatically failover push notification traffic to legacy channel if the primary channel experiences degradation.We are improving our public documentation so it recommends customers to complete the MFA request by opening up Microsoft Authenticator App and approving the request.In the longer term, we are improving the user experience to convey that they can complete the MFA request by opening the Authenticator App, if they are not receiving push notification.\\nHow can we make our incident communications more useful?\\nYou can rate this PIR and provide any feedback using our quick 3-question survey.', metadata={'source': 'FKPH-7Z8'})], 'question': 'what are the Authentication issues?', 'language': 'English', 'output_text': 'For Tracking ID FLX7-VD8, the Authentication issues were caused by a code issue when refreshing the Microsoft Authenticator app using the Pull-to-Refresh feature on Android devices.
